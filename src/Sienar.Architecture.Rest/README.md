# Sienar.Architecture.Rest

This package adds REST endpoints as a data store for `IRepository<T>` instances. This is useful for Blazor WASM applications, desktop applications that use a REST API as a data store, and other types of applications that utilize REST APIs such as a client-facing Razor Pages or Blazor Server app that calls REST endpoints on a private backend.

For more information, see the [Sienar docs](https://sienar.io).
