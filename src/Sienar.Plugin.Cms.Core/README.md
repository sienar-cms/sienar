# Sienar.Plugin.Cms.Core

This package contains the core Sienar CMS code. If you want to hack something together out of Sienar's base pieces, or if you're creating a plugin on top of Sienar CMS, you should install this package by itself. Otherwise, you should reference one of the other high-level Sienar packages.

For more information, see the [Sienar docs](https://sienar.io).
