# Sienar.Utils.Blazor

This package contains the core utilities used by all Blazor applications built with Sienar, such as an `AuthenticationStateProvider` and root `<SienarApp>` and `<SienarHead>` components.

You probably don't want to use this package directly unless you need access to the utilities it provides - you're probably looking for a higher-level package, such as **Sienar.Architecture.Wasm** or **Sienar.Architecture.Maui**, which all contain references to this package.

For more information, see the [Sienar docs](https://sienar.io).
