# Sienar.Plugin.Cms.Blazor

This package contains the CMS portion of Sienar, packaged as a Blazor United application. If you want basic UI, user login, account administration, media uploads, etc. managed for you, you're in the right place. If you'd rather handle those things yourself, you should use one of Sienar's lower-level packages instead.

For more information, see the [Sienar docs](https://sienar.levesque.dev).
