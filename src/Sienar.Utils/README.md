# Sienar.Utils

This package contains the core utilities used by all desktop and web applications built with the Sienar system, including menu generation, data access abstractions, hooks, and more.

You probably don't want to use this package directly unless you need access to the utilities it provides - you're probably looking for a higher-level package, such as **Sienar.Architecture.Web**, which all contain references to this package. 

For more information, see the [Sienar docs](https://sienar.io).
