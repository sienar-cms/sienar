# Sienar.Plugins.Identity.Shared

This package contains the core Sienar application code that is shared between the client and the server. If you want to hack something together out of Sienar's base pieces, or if you're creating a plugin on top of Sienar Core, you should install this package by itself. Otherwise, you should reference one of the other high-level Sienar packages.

For more information, see the [Sienar docs](https://sienar.io).
