# Sienar.Plugins.Core.Client

This package contains the core web application portion of Sienar, packaged as a Blazor United application. If you want basic UI, user login, account administration, etc. managed for you, you're in the right place. If you'd rather handle those things yourself, you should use one of Sienar's lower-level packages instead.

For more information, see the [Sienar docs](https://sienar.levesque.dev).
